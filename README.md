Developing an innovative solution to bridge the gap between food waste and hunger by creating an efficient and scalable platform that connects food donors (such as restaurants, grocery stores, and households) with food receivers (including shelters, food banks, and low-income families). The platform ensures timely and safe redistribution of surplus food to reduce waste and provide nourishment to those in need, contributing to the global goal of zero hunger. The solution includes real-time inventory updates & geo-location services.This initiative not only addresses immediate hunger but also contributes to the long-term global goal of zero hunger. Through collective efforts and technological innovation, we can build a more sustainable and equitable food system, ensuring that no food goes to waste and no one goes hungry.
